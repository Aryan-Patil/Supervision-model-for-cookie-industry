# Supervision-model-for-cookie-industry

Supervision and processing in the cookie industry uses image recognition methods and Python programming and its libraries can provide a system that reduces the cost of the machinery required for production of the cookie by decreasing the number of production lines to one and also segregates the same-flavor cookies into different patterns and shapes to help the machines easily package every cookie differently on the basis of shape. It also provides a quality assurance method that compares the size of the respective cookie to its standard size to decide whether the cookie meets the quality standard or not. It also uses the colour detection method to check if the cookie is overbaked or underbaked. The model focuses on providing a user interface for virtually supervising the whole process and also reducing human errors, as food quality is the most important aspect in the respective industry.
